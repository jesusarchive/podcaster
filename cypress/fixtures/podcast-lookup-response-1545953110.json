She earned her doctoral degree at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, researching the effects of deliberate cold and deliberate heat exposure on metabolism and other aspects of human physiology. We discuss how cold or sauna can improve metabolism, cardiovascular and brain health, balance hormones, and decrease inflammation. Dr. Søberg discusses how deliberate cold protocols can improve glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity and trigger release of neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine which enhance energy, mood, and focus. We compare cold showers and cold immersion, traditional and infrared saunas, and other variables. This episode provides actionable tools and answers to common questions about the use of deliberate cold and heat to improve health.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nPlunge: https://plunge.com/huberman\nMaui Nui: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nThe Brain Body Contract\nTickets: https://hubermanlab.com/tour\nPresale code: HUBERMAN\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Susanna Søberg\n(00:03:23) Sponsors: Plunge, Maui Nui, Thesis\n(00:06:49) The Brain-Body Contract\n(00:07:40) Physiology in Uncomfortably Cold Environments\n(00:12:05) Tool: Water Temperature, “Cold Shock” & Discomfort\n(00:17:37) Cold Showers vs. Immersion in Water, Brown Fat\n(00:22:11) Cold Receptors, Brown Fat & Temperature Homeostasis\n(00:25:22) Shiver, “After Drop”, Healthy Stress\n(00:31:08) Long-Term Health Benefits of Deliberate Cold Exposure\n(00:35:48) Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n(00:37:02) Blood Pressure & Heath\n(00:38:26) Brown Fat, Insulin Sensitivity & Metabolism\n(00:45:07) Temperature Regulation, Brown Fat vs. White Fat\n(00:52:26) Cold Resilience, Scandinavia\n(00:59:07) Sponsor: InsideTracker\n(01:00:16) Winter Swimmers & Brown Fat; Discomfort\n(01:10:28) Sex differences & Brown Fat, Cold-Adapted\n(01:15:21) Diving Reflex & Parasympathetic Activation\n(01:18:44) Tool: Deliberate Cold & Sauna Protocol\n(01:23:11) Winter Swimmers, Shiver; Circadian Rhythm & Brown Fat\n(01:31:14) Tool: Minimum Threshold for Cold & Heat; Sauna & Cardiovascular Health\n(01:35:19) Tool: Maintaining Stimulus when Cold-Adapted; Shorter Sessions\n(01:38:09) Cold Exposure, Sleep Quality, Clothing\n(01:47:37) “Brown Fat Negative” & Shiver\n(01:52:13) Cold & Heat, Inflammation Reduction\n(01:55:40) Tool: “Soberg Principle”: End on Cold, Metabolism\n(01:59:39) Cold Exposure: Fed or Fasted?\n(02:00:32) Raynaud’s Syndrome; Hand/Feet Protection in Cold\n(02:05:21) Tool: Headache & Cold Exposure; Head Submersion & Head Coverings\n(02:11:29) Children & Hypothermia Risk\n(02:17:16) Gender Differences & Cold Exposure\n(02:19:57) Tool: Brief, Repeated Temperature Changes; Circadian Rhythm & Temperature\n(2:27:53) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

I discuss the emerging clinical trial evidence for the use of psilocybin in the treatment of depression, addictions and other psychiatric challenges. I explain the typical duration and phases of a psilocybin journey, the different categories of dosages often used and I explain the importance of set, setting and support when using psychedelics. I explain which groups of people place themselves at great risk by taking psilocybin as well as groups that could benefit, and I highlight the rapidly changing legal and medical landscape around psilocybin. This episode is a thorough exploration of psilocybin from the scientific and clinical literature perspective and ought to be of interest to anyone curious about psilocybin, mental health, neuroplasticity and/or psychedelics more generally.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman\nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Psilocybin, Legal Considerations\n(00:08:32) Sponsors: Eight Sleep, ROKA, HVMN\n(00:12:00) Psilocybin Becomes Psilocin in the Gut, Serotonin\n(00:17:00) The Serotonin 2A Receptor, Therapeutic Outcomes SSRIs vs. Psilocybin\n(00:21:40) Serotonin Receptor Expression; Visual Hallucinations & Eyes Closed\n(00:27:21) Safety & Cautions for Specific Patient Populations\n(00:29:13) Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n(00:30:28) Psilocybin, “Magic Mushrooms” Dosing, Micro-Dosing, “Heroic Doses”\n(00:36:21) Psychedelic Journey: Set, Setting & Support\n(00:43:43) Music & the Psilocybin Journey; Duration of Effects\n(00:48:58) Psilocybin & the Brain: Subjective Experiences, Perception\n(00:58:36) Sponsor: LMNT\n(00:59:48) Brain Networks & Therapeutic Outcomes\n(01:05:23) Creativity; Music, Emotionality & Psychedelic Journeys\n(01:12:39) Depression & Psychedelics as Neuroplasticity “Wedge”\n(01:16:53) Positive Psychedelic Journeys, Unity, “Oceanic Boundlessness”\n(01:25:23) “Bad Trips”, Anxiety & Physiological Sighs\n(01:32:57) Therapeutic Use of Psilocybin\n(01:36:11) Neuroplasticity, Structural Brain Changes & Psilocybin\n(01:48:08) Psychedelics: Therapeutic Breakthroughs & Depression\n(01:56:37) Combining Psilocybin Therapy & Talk Therapy, Antidepressant Effects\n(02:03:11) Psilocybin Experience & Mental Health\n(2:06:42) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

      "description": "In this episode, my guest is Noam Sobel, PhD, professor of neurobiology in the department of brain sciences at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Dr. Sobel explains his lab’s research on the biological mechanisms of smell (“olfaction”) and how sensing odorants and chemicals in our environment impacts human behavior, cognition, social connections, and hormones. He explains how smell is a crucial component of “social sensing” and how we use olfaction when meeting new people to determine things about their physiology and psychology, and he explains how this impacts friendships and romantic partners. He explains how smell influences emotions, hormone levels, memories and the relationship between breathing and autonomic homeostasis. He describes how smell-based screening tests can aid disease diagnosis and explains his lab’s work on digitization of smell — which may soon allow online communication to include “sending of odors” via the internet. Dr. Sobel’s work illustrates how sensitive human olfaction is and how it drives much of our biology and behavior.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Noam Sobel\n(00:03:46) Sponsors: ROKA, Thesis, Helix Sleep\n(00:06:46) Olfaction Circuits (Smell)\n(00:14:49) Loss & Regeneration of Smell, Illness\n(00:21:39) Brain Processing of Smell\n(00:24:40) Smell & Memories\n(00:27:52) Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n(00:29:07) Humans & Odor Tracking\n(00:39:25) The Alternating Nasal Cycle & Autonomic Nervous System\n(00:48:18) Cognitive Processing & Breathing\n(00:54:47) Neurodegenerative Diseases & Olfaction\n(01:00:12) Congenital Anosmia\n(01:05:01) Sponsor: InsideTracker\n(01:06:19) Handshaking, Sharing Chemicals & Social Sensing\n(01:15:07) Smelling Ourselves & Smelling Others\n(01:22:02) Odors & Romantic Attraction\n(01:24:58) Vomeronasal Organ, “Bruce Effect” & Miscarriage\n(01:40:20) Social Chemo-Signals, Fear\n(01:50:26) Chemo-Signaling, Aggression & Offspring\n(02:03:57) Menstrual Cycle Synchronization\n(02:12:11) Sweat, Tears, Emotions & Testosterone\n(02:27:46) Science Politics\n(02:37:54) Food Odors & Nutritional Value\n(02:45:34) Human Perception & Odorant Similarity\n(02:52:12) Digitizing Smell, COVID-19 & Smell\n(03:05:50) Medical Diagnostic Future & Olfaction Digitization\n(03:10:55) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

I discuss neuroplasticity-based skill development and the roles of focus, sleep, movement restriction, and agitation. I then present five key principles of mental visualization to enhance learning speed, accuracy, and consistency. I also provide examples of specific protocols, including repetitions, rest periods, and session frequency, and how to adapt these methods for injuries or breaks from traditional training. Throughout, I reference the scientific studies supporting these concepts. This episode should allow anyone to learn or teach more effectively through the use of mental visualization and training.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nMaui Nui: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Mental Training & Visualization\n(00:04:46) Sponsors: LMNT, Maui Nui, Eight Sleep\n(00:08:04) Developmental vs. Adult Neuroplasticity\n(00:11:42) Learning New Skills: Focus & Sleep\n(00:14:49) Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), Long-Term Depression (LTD) & New Skills\n(00:23:42) Principle #1: Very Brief, Simple, Repeated Visualization\n(00:29:36) Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n(00:30:51) Principle #2: Mental Training Cannot Replace Real Training\n(00:37:36) Principle #3: Combining Real & Mental Training\n(00:43:17) Principle #4: Assigning Real-World Labels to Visualizations\n(00:50:37) Principle #5: Mental Imagery Equivalence to Real-World Perception\n(00:55:28) Tools: Effective Mental Training: Epochs, Repetitions, Sets & Frequency\n(01:03:43) Sponsor: InsideTracker\n(01:05:00) Adding Mental Training; Injury, Travel or Layoffs\n(01:11:09) Timing of Mental Training & Sleep\n(01:15:17) Role of Gender & Age on Mental Training\n(01:17:10) First-Person vs. Third-Person Visualization; Eyes Open vs. Closed\n(01:23:53) Physical Skills, Motor Cortex & Cerebellum\n(01:31:15) “Go” & “No-Go” Pathways\n(01:34:19) Stop-Signal Task, Withholding Action\n(01:44:19) Aphantasia, Synesthesia; Social Cognition\n(01:52:58) Mental Training Practice & Benefits\n(01:57:36) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

Dr. MacDougall trained at the University of California, San Diego and Stanford University School of Medicine and is a world expert in brain stimulation, repair and augmentation. He explains Neuralink’s mission and projects to develop and use neural implant technologies and robotics to 1) restore normal movement to paralyzed patients and those with neurodegeneration-based movement disorders (e.g., Parkinson’s, Huntington’s Disease) and to repair malfunctions of deep brain circuitry (e.g., those involved in addiction). He also discusses Neuralink’s efforts to create novel brain-machine interfaces (BMI) that enhance human learning, cognition and communication as a means to accelerate human progress. Dr. MacDougall also explains other uses of bio-integrated machines in daily life; for instance, he implanted himself with a radio chip into his hand that allows him to open specific doors, collect and store data and communicate with machines and other objects in unique ways. Listeners will learn about brain health and function through the lens of neurosurgery, neurotechnology, clinical medicine and Neuralink’s bold and unique mission. Anyone interested in how the brain works and can be made to work better ought to derive value from this discussion.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman\nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Matthew MacDougall\n(00:04:05) Sponsors: HVMN, Levels, Thesis\n(00:07:38) Brain Function & Injury; Brain Tumor Treatment\n(00:13:52) Frontal Lobe Filter; Sleep Deprivation\n(00:19:00) Neuroplasticity, Pharmacology & Machines\n(00:22:10) Neuralink, Neural Implants & Injury, Robotics & Surgery\n(00:31:05) Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n(00:32:20) Neocortex vs. Deep Brain\n(00:36:45) Decoding Brain Signals\n(00:42:08) “Confidence Test” & Electrical Stimulation; RFID Implants\n(00:51:33) Bluetooth Headphones & Electromagnetic Fields; Heat\n(00:57:43) Brain Augmentation & Paralysis\n(01:00:51) Sponsor: InsideTracker\n(01:02:09) Brain Implants & Peripheral Devices\n(01:12:44) Brain Machine Interface (BMI), Neurofeedback; Video Games\n(01:22:13) Improving Animal Experimentation, Pigs\n(01:33:18) Skull & Injury, Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)\n(01:39:14) Brain Health, Alcohol\n(01:43:34) Neuroplasticity, Brain Lesions & Redundancy\n(01:47:32) Car Accidents & Driver Alertness\n(01:50:00) Future Possibilities in Brain Augmentation & BMI; Neuralink\n(01:58:56) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

      "description": "In this episode, I explain the biology of hair, hair growth, why hair growth slows and what causes hair to stop growing and/or “fall out.” I discuss the essential role of hair stem cells and other supporting biological factors for healthy hair growth. Then I describe various approaches (mechanical and chemical) to slow hair loss by increasing blood flow to hair stem cells, including minoxidil, tadalafil, PRP, microneedling, Botox and ketoconazole treatments. I also discuss how age-related hormone changes cause hair loss and explain the effectiveness of treatments such as caffeine, saw palmetto, growth hormone, finasteride and dutasteride. For all hair growth options, I describe potential side effects, how soon to expect results and the amount of hair regrowth to expect and I highlight effective combination treatments for hair regrowth even in hair “dead” (bald) zones. For many listeners, thinning, brittle hair, or pattern baldness are a source of anxiety and stress. This episode explains the mechanisms underlying hair regrowth tools and the science behind them so that you can evaluate potential treatments and associated side-effect profiles and select the best one(s) for you.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman\nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Hair\n(00:04:13) Sponsors: Helix Sleep, HVMN, ROKA\n(00:08:04) Psychological States & Hair\n(00:13:19) Hair Anatomy & Stem Cells\n(00:26:05) 3 Phases of Hair Growth\n(00:35:40) Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n(00:36:55) Minoxidil & Blood Flow\n(00:45:37) Increase Blood Flow: Massage, Tadalafil, Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP), Microneedling\n(00:56:10) Microneedling, Minoxidil & “Dead Zones”\n(01:00:13) Sponsor: LMNT\n(01:01:25) Botox Treatments\n(01:06:27) Androgens, Hair Growth & Pattern Hair Loss; Scalp vs. Beard Hair\n(01:15:46) Topical Caffeine & Slowing Hair Loss\n(01:21:06) IGF-1: Growth Hormone & Sermorelin; Insulin Sensitivity: Myo-Inositol\n(01:25:52) Iron & Hair Growth\n(01:27:04) 5-Alpha Reductase & Saw Palmetto; Curcumin\n(01:33:22) Ketoconazole & Offsetting Hair Loss\n(01:38:46) Topical & Oral Finasteride\n(01:51:00) Post- Finasteride Syndrome\n(01:56:01) Dutasteride\n(01:58:53) Mechanical & Chemical Stimulation for Hair Growth\n(02:02:46) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

We discuss her work showing how stress impacts mood, eating behavior, mental health, physical health, and aging. She explains stress intervention tools using “top-down” techniques (e.g., radical acceptance, mindfulness, reframing), body-based methods (e.g., breathwork) including the Wim Hof Method, exercise, meditation, body scans, and environmental shifts proven to help people cease unhealthy rumination patterns. We discuss how stress can positively impact psychology and sense of purpose, how stress affects cellular aging, how our narratives of stressful events impact our mood and biology, and how to effectively reframe stress. She explains science-based techniques to break stress-induced cycles of craving and overeating and thereby improve insulin sensitivity and metabolic health. Dr. Epel provides a wide range of tools shown to be effective in reducing stress and improving various aspects of our health.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Elissa Epel\n(00:02:17) Sponsors: Thesis, Eight Sleep, HVMN, Momentous\n(00:06:18) Stress; Effects on Body & Mind\n(00:12:50) Tools: Overthinking & Stress\n(00:15:37) Acute, Moderate & Chronic Stress, Breathing\n(00:21:23) Stress Benefits, Aging & Cognition; Stress Challenge Response\n(00:31:04) Sponsor: AG-1 (Athletic Greens)\n(00:32:19) Tool: Shifting Stress to Challenge Response, “Stress Shields”\n(00:37:400 Stress, Overeating, Craving & Opioid System\n(00:48:55) Tools: Breaking Overeating Cycles, Mindfulness\n(00:54:44) Soda & Sugary Drinks\n(01:00:51) Smoking, Processed Food & Rebellion\n(01:05:29) Sponsor: InsideTracker\n(01:06:47) Tools: Mindfulness, Pregnancy & Metabolic Health\n(01:14:11) Body Scan & Cravings\n(01:17:28) Tool: Meditation & Aging; Meditation Retreats\n(01:23:35) Meditation, Psychedelics & Neuroplasticity\n(01:26:02) Mitochondrial Health, Stress & Mood\n(01:29:49) Chronic Stress & Radical Acceptance, “Brick Wall”\n(01:37:57) Tool: Control, Uncertainty\n(01:45:25) Stress Management, “Skillful Surfing”\n(01:50:25) Narrative, Purpose & Stress\n(01:52:49) Breathwork, Wim Hof Method, Positivity & Cellular Aging\n(02:03:11) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

      "description": "In this episode, I explain how dopamine dynamics — meaning changes and interactions between our baseline and peak levels of dopamine drive our cravings and sense of motivation. I also explain how to leverage dopamine dynamics to overcome procrastination. I cover behavioral, cognitive, nutrition-based and supplementation-based tools to optimize baseline and peak dopamine levels to ensure a persistently motivated state. I also discuss how to boost motivation when you are in a rut, why you might not want to stack behaviors/substances that spike dopamine and how to build and maintain a “growth mindset” for pursuing goals of any kind. Dopamine is an incredibly powerful neuromodulator involved in basic functions (e.g., hunger, romantic attraction, etc.) and feats of cognitive and physical performance; by understanding the dynamics of dopamine, listeners ought to be better positioned to overcome procrastination, maintain motivation, and improve confidence.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nWHOOP: https://join.whoop.com/huberman\nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dopamine\n(00:02:32) Sponsors: Helix Sleep, WHOOP, ROKA, Momentous\n(00:06:27) Dopamine Brain Circuits\n(00:14:53) Goals & Addiction\n(00:17:13) Dopamine Dynamics, “Wave Pool” analogy\n(00:20:28) Craving, Motivation, Pursuit & Reward Prediction Error\n(00:28:26) Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n(00:29:40) Feedback Cues & Reward Contingent Learning, “Scoreboard”\n(00:37:40) Addiction; Pleasure & Pain Imbalance\n(00:44:55) Dopamine Release & Addictive Substances/Behaviors\n(00:50:43) Addiction Recovery, Binding Behaviors\n(00:53:25) Tools: Maintain Baseline Dopamine Levels\n(01:02:08) Sponsor: InsideTracker\n(01:03:26) Tool: Deliberate Cold Exposure & Dopamine\n(01:09:38) Prescriptions & Supplementation: L-Tyrosine, Mucuna Pruriens\n(01:18:58) Dopamine Trough Recovery, Postpartum Depression\n(01:23:31) Dopamine Dynamics, “Dopamine Stacking”; Intrinsic Motivation\n(01:38:10) Making Effort the Reward, Growth Mindset\n(01:41:49) Tool: Overcome Procrastination\n(01:52:16) Tool: Meditation & Procrastination\n(01:57:01) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

Dr. Attia is host of the health and medicine podcast, The Drive, and the author of a new book, “Outlive: The Science & Art of Longevity,” which examines disease prevention and healthy aging, including emotional health. He explains the leading causes of death worldwide and how to measure one’s risk of death and mitigate each risk factor. Dr. Attia shares how, in addition to blood-based markers of lipids and hormones, there are behavioral measures and interventions, and key aspects of emotional health (i.e., relationships, emotional stability, purpose, etc.) that fundamentally impact our physical health and longevity, and how to assess and adjust our emotional health. This episode is rich with actionable information related to disease screening and biomarker testing, nutritional, exercise, behavior and prescription-based tools that area useful to all people regardless of age, male or female, and that can significantly improve vitality, health and lifespan.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman  \nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Peter Attia\n(00:03:22) Sponsors: Eight Sleep, LMNT, HVMN, Momentous\n(00:07:34) Lifespan vs. Healthspan\n(00:10:54) “4 Horseman of Death”, Diseases of Atherosclerosis\n(00:14:44) Tool: Hypertension & Stroke, Blood Pressure Testing \n(00:23:14) Preventing Atherosclerosis, Smoking & Vaping, Pollution\n(00:32:24) Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n(00:33:29) Cholesterol, ApoB\n(00:42:21) Cholesterol Levels, LDL & ApoB Testing\n(00:49:29) ApoB Levels & Atherosclerosis, Causality\n(01:01:06) ApoB Reduction, Insulin Resistance, Statins, Ezetimibe, PCSK9 Inhibitors\n(01:12:30) Monitoring ApoB\n(01:17:12) Sponsor: InsideTracker\n(01:18:30) Reducing Blood Pressure, Exercise & Sleep\n(01:20:50) High Blood Pressure & Kidneys\n(01:23:11) Alcohol, Sleep & Disease Risk\n(01:31:21) Cancer & Cancer Risks: Genetics, Smoking & Obesity\n(01:39:47) Cancer Screening & Survival\n(01:44:17) Radiation Risks, CT & PET Scans\n(01:48:48) Environmental Carcinogens\n(01:52:11) Genetic & Whole-Body MRI Screening, Colonoscopy\n(01:58:47) Neurodegenerative Diseases, Alzheimer’s Disease, ApoE\n(02:08:08) Alzheimer’s Disease & Amyloid\n(02:13:58) Interventions for Brain Health, Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)\n(02:21:26) Accidental Death, “Deaths of Despair”, Fentanyl Crisis\n(02:31:20) Fall Risk & Stability, 4 Pillars of Strength Training\n(02:41:05) Emotional Health\n(02:53:45) Mortality & Preserving Relationship Quality\n(03:02:20) Relationships vs. Outcomes, Deconstructing Emotions\n(03:09:34) Treatment Centers, Emotional Processing & Recovery\n(03:16:34) Tool: Inner Monologue & Anger, Redirecting Self-Talk\n(03:27:37) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

We discuss his lab’s discovery that “time-restricted eating” (TRE) aka intermittent fasting, is beneficial effects for metabolic health and longevity. Dr. Panda explains how TRE, and also longer fasts, can positively impact obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular health, age-related chronic diseases, and improve mood and cognitive performance. He also describes how the timing of eating, light exposure and exercise that ~50% of all people engage in, negatively impacts their health and explains how specific simple adjustments to these can positively shift their subjective feelings of health and biomarkers of cardiovascular function, glucose regulation and metabolism. We discuss how our circadian behaviors, which include our patterns of eating, sleeping and socializing, have an enormous impact on our biology, mood and health and how by simply confining our calorie consumption to a semi-regular daily window, can positively impact our physical health, mental health and longevity.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Satchin Panda\n(00:03:02) Sponsors: HVMN, Eight Sleep, Thesis, Momentous\n(00:07:24) Time-Restricted Eating (TRE), Calorie Restriction (CR) & Health\n(00:14:38) Mealtimes & Circadian Clock\n(00:21:34) Circadian Rhythm, Meal Anticipation, Digestion\n(00:25:28) Breaking a Fast, Burning Fat\n(00:32:49) Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n(00:34:04) CR, Time Restricted Eating, Circadian Rhythm & Longevity\n(00:47:20) Gender, Hormones & CR; Relative Energy Deficient in Sports (REDS)\n(00:52:40) Physical Activity, Nutrition & Feeding Window\n(00:59:04) Nutrition Timing, Quality & Quantity; Low- Carbohydrate Diet\n(01:03:00) Caffeine, Nighttime Socialization, Fire, Breakfast\n(01:15:07) Sponsor: InsideTracker\n(01:16:20) Circadian Rhythm, “Night Owls” & Genetics\n(01:26:37) Morning vs. Nighttime Discussions, “Me Time”\n(01:30:08) Light Sensitivity & “Night Owls”; Puberty, Melatonin\n(01:36:05) Shift Workers, Health & Disease\n(01:45:43) Artificial Lights, Young Adults & Sleep, Metabolic Dysfunction\n(01:50:59) Firefighters, Sleep & TRE; Cardiovascular Health, Blood Glucose\n(02:05:18) Shift Workers & Sleep; Alcohol & Caffeine\n(02:09:15) 12- Hour Feeding Window for Adults & Children, Sleep\n(02:22:10) Meal Timing\n(02:25:20) “Complete Fast”, Longer Fasts, Physical Health & Mental Health\n(02:28:12) “Fat Fasting”, Blood Glucose & Insulin\n(02:31:57) Fasting, Metformin, Rapamycin & Longevity; Human Applicability?\n(02:39:14) Circadian Rhythm & Metabolism\n(02:41:36) Ontime Health App, Circadian Clock App\n(02:46:17) Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

I explain the structure of water and how it is used by the cells and tissues of our body, how much water we each need to drink and when in order to optimize our mental focus and physical performance; and I include how exercise, humidity, heat, and caffeine affect our hydration needs. I explain how temperature and pH influence water’s physical properties and if there is any scientific basis for drinking so-called “pH water” or “alkalized water” to improve health. I explain how to test your tap water for contaminants (e.g., endocrine disruptors) and the documented problems with fluoride in drinking water. I provide options for filtering drinking water and describe different water types (e.g., reverse osmosis, hydrogen-enriched, electrolyzed reduced, deuterium depleted, etc.). Since the human body is mostly water (55-80% depending on one’s age) and water has essential roles in health, disease and cellular function, everyone ought to benefit from understanding how best to clean our tap water, hydrate effectively and in some cases, adjust the type of water we drink to allow our brain and body to function optimally in regard to health and performance.\nFor recommended water filters, tests and the full show notes, please visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Water\n(00:03:33) Tool Deliberate Cold Exposure, Immersion & Showers Mood & Fat Loss\n(00:15:26) Sponsors: LMNT, Thesis, HVMN, Momentous\n(00:19:27) Water: Physical Properties & Chemistry\n(00:26:32) Bonds & Water Phases, “Structured Water”\n(00:34:07) Body, Cells & Water\n(00:36:22) Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n(00:37:37) Water as a Solvent, Temperature & pH\n(00:41:49) Water Transport in Cells, Aquaporin Channels\n(00:49:46) Alkaline/pH Water; Temperature, pH & Water Transport\n(00:55:14) Water Cellular Function, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) & Antioxidants\n(01:01:20) Sponsor: InsideTracker\n(01:02:38) Tool: Baseline Hydration\n(01:11:35) Tool: Hydration & Exercise, Galpin Equation\n(01:15:40) Tool: Hydration, Sauna, Humidity & Sweat; Thirst, Caffeine\n(01:19:15) Hydration; Cognitive & Physical Performance \n(01:23:53) Tool: Water Filtration; Nighttime Urination\n(01:29:35) Tap Water Tests, Disinfection Byproducts (DBPs), Fluoride & Thyroid Health\n(01:37:18) Tool: Water Filters\n(01:44:18) Tool: Resting Tap Water & Sediment\n(01:48:13) Tool: “Hard Water”; Magnesium, Calcium & Cardiovascular Health\n(01:53:40) Water Temperature\n(01:56:42) Water Types: Distilled, Reverse Osmosis, Hydrogen-Enriched\n(02:03:26) Hydrogen-Enriched Water, Magnesium, Optimize Hydration\n(02:11:13) Tool: Molecular Hydrogen Tablets, Water pH\n(02:14:05) Structured Water\n(02:16:39) Tool: Water Pipes, Faucet Filter\n(02:19:42) Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

      "description": "In this episode, my guest is Oded Rechavi, Ph.D., professor of neurobiology at Tel Aviv University and expert in how genes are inherited, how experiences shape genes and remarkably, how some memories of experiences can be passed via genes to offspring. We discuss his research challenging long-held tenets of genetic inheritance and the relevance of those findings to understanding key biological and psychological processes including metabolism, stress and trauma. He describes the history of the scientific exploration of the “heritability of acquired traits” and how epigenetics and RNA biology can account for some of the passage of certain experience-based memories. He discusses the importance of model organisms in scientific research and describes his work on how stressors and memories can be passed through small RNA molecules to multiple generations of offspring in ways that meaningfully affect their behavior. Nature vs. nurture is a commonly debated theme; Dr. Rechavi’s work represents a fundamental shift in our understanding of that debate, as well as genetic inheritance, brain function and evolution.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman\nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Oded Rechavi\n(00:02:08) Sponsors: ROKA, HVMN, Eight Sleep\n(00:06:04) DNA, RNA, Protein; Somatic vs. Germ Cells\n(00:14:36) Lamarckian Evolution, Inheritance of Acquired Traits\n(00:22:54) Paul Kammerer & Toad Morphology\n(00:28:52) AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n(00:30:06) James McConnell & Memory Transfer\n(00:37:31) Weismann Barrier; Epigenetics \n(00:45:13) Epigenetic Reprogramming; Imprinted Genes \n(00:50:43) Nature vs. Nurture; Epigenetics & Offspring\n(00:59:06) Generational Epigenetic Inheritance \n(01:09:03) Sponsor: InsideTracker\n(01:10:20) Model Organisms, C. elegans\n(01:21:50) C. elegans & Inheritance of Acquired Traits, Small RNAs\n(01:26:02) RNA Interference, C. elegans & Virus Immunity\n(01:34:13) RNA Amplification, Multi-Generational Effects\n(01:38:41) Response Duration & Environment\n(01:47:50) Generational Memory Transmission, RNA\n(01:59:36) Germ Cells & Behavior; Body Cues\n(02:04:48) Transmission of Sexual Choice\n(02:11:22) Fertility & Human Disease; 3-Parent In Vitro Fertilization (IVF); RNA Testing\n(02:17:56) Deliberate Cold Exposure, Learning & Memory\n(02:29:26) Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

      "description": "In this episode, I explain the biology of breathing (respiration), how it delivers oxygen and carbon dioxide to the cells and tissues of the body and how is best to breathe—nose versus mouth, fast versus slow, deliberately versus reflexively, etc., depending on your health and performance needs. I discuss the positive benefits of breathing properly for mood, to reduce psychological and physiological stress, to halt sleep apnea, and improve facial aesthetics and immune system function. I also compare what is known about the effects and effectiveness of different breathing techniques, including physiological sighs, box breathing and cyclic hyperventilation, “Wim Hof Method,” Prānāyāma yogic breathing and more. I also describe how to breath to optimize learning, memory and reaction time and I explain breathing at high altitudes, why “overbreathing” is bad, and how to breathe specifically to relieve cramps and hiccups. Breathwork practices are zero-cost and require minimal time yet provide a unique and powerful avenue to improve overall quality of life that is grounded in clear physiology. Anyone interesting in improving their mental and physical health or performance in any endeavor ought to benefit from the information and tools in this episode.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nWHOOP: https://join.whoop.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Breathing\n(00:05:41) Sponsors: HVMN, Thesis, WHOOP\n(00:09:36) Respiration, Oxygen & Carbon Dioxide\n(00:18:18) Breathing Mechanics\n(00:30:08) AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n(00:31:23) Chemistry of Breathing, Hyperventilation\n(00:40:35) High Altitudes, Oxygen & Breathing\n(00:47:16) Tool: Sleep Apnea, Nasal Breathing\n(00:51:50) Brain Centers & Breathing Rhythm\n(00:57:23) Brain, Hyperventilation & “Over-breathing”\n(01:03:53) What is Healthy Breathing?\n(01:08:26) InsideTracker\n(01:09:44) Tool: Train Healthy Breathing, Carbon Dioxide Tolerance Test & Box Breathing\n(01:22:39) Tool: Breathwork & Stress Reduction; Cyclic Sighing\n(01:33:56) Tool: Physiological Sighing & Exercise Side Cramp\n(01:39:16) Breathing & Heart Rate Variability\n(01:46:21) Tool: How to Stop Hiccups\n(01:51:17) Tool: Stress Management & Cyclic Hyperventilation, “Wim Hof Method”\n(01:57:11) Deliberate Cold Exposure & Breathing\n(01:59:54) Tool: Inhales & Learning; Exhales & Movement\n(02:09:15) Mouth vs. Nasal Breathing, Aesthetics\n(02:16:19) Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

He explains the cellular mechanisms of muscle soreness and pain, why adequate recovery is essential for all physical adaptations, and how to enhance recovery using breathwork, thermal, movement, and pressure-based techniques. He describes how overtraining impedes exercise progress and how to assess if you are overreaching or overtraining, by using specific biomarkers and indicators. Like other performance metrics, recovery is a skill that can and should be trained, and that can be learned. This episode provides an actionable toolkit for how to monitor and improve your exercise recovery abilities, which will improve your overall mental and physical health.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Recovery\n(00:04:17) Exercise & Delayed Muscle Soreness, Pain\n(00:11:35) Muscle Spindles, Reduce Soreness\n(00:18:56) Exercise, Homeostasis & Hormesis; Blood Test & Fitness Level\n(00:30:20) Recovery Timescales, Adaptation & Optimization\n(00:35:10) Adaptation & Biomarkers Levels\n(00:40:36) 4 Recovery Levels, Enhance Recovery\n(00:47:28) AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n(00:48:19) Overreaching vs. Overtraining\n(00:52:53) Tool: Acute Overload & Recovery, Breathwork\n(01:03:39) Tool: Alleviate Acute Soreness, Compression Clothing\n(01:08:27) Tool: Acute Soreness, Massage, Temperature\n(01:14:21) Cold & Heat Contrast, Cold Shower vs. Immersion, Sauna & Fertility\n(01:20:44) InsideTracker\n(01:21:46) Combine Recovery Techniques\n(01:24:34) Monitoring for Overreaching & Overtraining\n(01:31:33) Overreaching/Overtraining, Performance & Physiology, Sleep\n(01:45:41) Overreaching/Overtraining, Biomarkers, Cortisol\n(01:50:45) Cortisol, Daily Levels & Performance; Rhodiola Supplementation\n(02:01:25) Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep\n(02:05:05) Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)\n(02:15:07) Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones\n(02:25:04) Mirrors & Resistance Training\n(02:29:01) Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”\n(02:32:43) Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy\n(02:39:45) Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery \n(02:42:41) Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers\n(02:50:06) Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution\n(03:00:08) Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements\n(03:03:45) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

We discuss her research exploring how sleep impacts learning, memory, hormones and emotions. She discusses tools to enhance your quality of sleep, increase deep sleep, rapid eye movement sleep and growth hormone release-- a key hormone for health, immune function and vitality. Dr. Poe explains how a specific brain area, the locus coeruleus, facilitates the processing of emotions, helps relieve traumas and how to maximize locus coeruleus function. She also explains sleep’s vital role in opiate addiction recovery and how anyone can determine their optimal sleep timing and duration.

      "description": "This is episode 3 of a 6-part special series on fitness, exercise and performance with Andy Galpin, PhD, professor of kinesiology at California State University, Fullerton. He explains protocols to improve the various kinds of physical endurance: muscular endurance, anerobic capacity, maximum aerobic output, and long duration endurance. He also explains how the body uses different energy sources (carbohydrates, proteins, fats) during rest and exercise. He also explains the mechanisms underlying fat loss and how and why exercise accelerates rates of fat loss. We cover the many concepts related to endurance training and fat loss such as metabolic flexibility, breathwork training for exercise performance and recovery, lactate production and regulation, how to improve blood flow to muscles, anaerobic vs. aerobic metabolism, exercise fatigue, low-carbohydrate diets and fat loss, and how to combine different types of workouts to improve overall endurance. This episode in intended for everyone ranging from novice and recreational exercisers to elite endurance athletes.

      "description": "In this episode, I discuss the mechanisms by which human eggs and sperm are generated, the ovulatory/menstrual cycle, the conception process and overall fertility in males and females. I also explain how, regardless of whether you seek to conceive children, optimizing egg and sperm health is directly related to vitality and longevity. I cover the nutrition-based, behavioral, supplement-based and prescription approaches to optimizing egg and sperm health, the ovulatory/menstrual cycle and fertility. In addition, I explain lifestyle choices that greatly assist or harm fertility—several of which are very surprising. I provide science-based protocols for those trying to conceive children. The tools and principles I discuss can also improve overall vitality and longevity in all people, regardless of age. \nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nMaui Nui: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Fertility, Vitality & Longevity\n(00:04:24) Maui Nui Venison, Eight Sleep, Momentous\n(00:08:20) Eggs & Sperm, Genes, Fertilization\n(00:18:28) Puberty: Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH), Melatonin & Leptin\n(00:23:38) Onset Trends of Puberty, Odors Effects\n(00:31:24) Female Puberty, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)\n(00:35:25) AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n(00:36:34) Ovulatory & Menstrual Cycle\n(00:40:36) Follicular Phase: Egg Maturation & Ovulation, FSH & Estrogen\n(00:51:09) Luteal Phase: Progesterone & Estrogen, Menstruation\n(00:58:14) Ovulation & Libido; Luteal Phase & Malaise; Individual Variability\n(01:03:14) InsideTracker\n(01:04:18) Sex Chromosomes, Sperm\n(01:11:40) Tool: Testicular Temperature & Fertility\n(01:17:22) Sperm Production, Seminal Fluid, Vasectomy\n(01:24:07) Sperm Cells, Mitochondria & Motility, Intercourse Frequency & Fertilization\n(01:28:31) Sperm Production, GnRH, FSH, LH & Testosterone\n(01:36:21) Ejaculate Quality, Sperm Counts, Fertilization, Ectopic Pregnancy\n(01:44:14) Tool: Sexual Intercourse Frequency & Fertilization\n(01:53:24) Tools: Tracking Ovulation, Libido, Lubricants\n(01:56:42) Fecundability: Egg Quality & Woman’s Age, Cumulative Pregnancy Rate\n(02:08:17) Miscarriages, Chromosomal Abnormalities\n(02:11:23) Female Fertility: Age, Follicle Testing & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Testing\n(02:18:51) Male Fertility: Sperm Analysis, Age\n(02:24:52) Fertility & Hormone Analysis, Age\n(02:29:07) Fertility Effects of Sleep, Cortisol/Stress, Cannabis/Nicotine & Alcohol\n(02:42:40) Fertility, Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs), Viral Infection & Cystic Fibrosis\n(02:47:42) Tool: Testicular Temperature & Fertility\n(02:51:26) Tool: Phones & Sperm Quality\n(02:58:06) Deliberate Cold Exposure & Fertility, Testicular Temperature, Cortisol/Stress\n(03:05:43) Fertility, Exercise & Mitochondrial Health; Intermittent Fasting\n(03:14:46) Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Sperm Production; Supplements\n(03:20:36) Sex Determination in Offspring, In Vitro Fertilization (IVF), Sperm Fractions\n(03:32:23) Postcoital Female Position & Fertilization, Sperm Quality\n(03:36:57) Cannabis & Sperm Motility, Libido, Pregnancy\n(03:42:33) Acupuncture, Fertility & Pregnancy\n(03:49:25) Fertility Supplements: L-Carnitine & Allicin, Coenzyme Q10\n(03:56:18) Fertility Supplements: Inositol, Omega 3 Fatty Acids\n(04:02:50) Supplements for Hormones: Tongkat Ali, Shilajit, Zinc\n(04:13:02) Fertility & Prescription Medications\n(04:16:44) Human Reproduction & Fertility\n(04:20:12) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nDisclaimer\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac",

Rick also shares his thoughts on using deadlines, eliminating distractions, and how our experiences and emotions influence the creative process. Additionally, we discuss his love for professional wrestling.

      "description": "In this episode, I explain how to design a supplementation protocol to support maximum mental and physical health and performance depending on your specific needs, nutrition, lifestyle and finances. When most people hear about “supplements,” they think they are vitamin supplements, but there are many compounds that are powerful and sold over-the-counter that can enhance our health in performance and that can’t be obtained from foods. First, I discuss “foundational” supplements to support overall health, including water and fat-soluble vitamins, minerals, digestive enzymes, adaptogens, and prebiotics/probiotics. Then I explain how to use single-ingredient supplements to enhance specific aspects of your physiology, such as aiding sleep, cognitive enhancement, and focus supporting healthy hormone levels (e.g., testosterone, estrogen and growth hormone, thyroid). Finally, I explain when it makes sense to add supplements to your lifestyle and discuss how best to use supplements, including how to determine dosage, sourcing, continuous schedules and cycling, and how to layer different supplements most effectively. This episode will explain how to design the safest, most biologically effective, cost-effective supplementation protocol to meet your particular goals and support your overall health, including vitality and longevity.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Supplements\n(00:03:38) Hierarchy of Tools/Interventions, Developing a Supplementation Protocol\n(00:11:51) Momentous, LMNT, Helix Sleep\n(00:15:38) Role of Supplements, Foundational Supplements, Water/Fat-Soluble Vitamins\n(00:21:07) Supplement Considerations: Cost, Nutrition & Schedule\n(00:25:25) Foundational Supplements, Digestive Enzymes, Adaptogens\n(00:28:04) Gut Microbiome, Probiotics/Prebiotics & Nutrition\n(00:33:06) Supplements for Gut Microbiome, Brain Fog\n(00:35:59) InsideTracker\n(00:36:44) Adaptogens & Broad-Spectrum Foundational Supplements\n(00:38:35) Core Supplement Questions & Meeting Foundational Needs\n(00:43:45) Supplements to Support Sleep: Myo-Inositol, Theanine\n(00:50:52) Supplements for Falling Asleep: Magnesium Threonate/Bisglycinate, Apigenin\n(00:55:55) Melatonin Caution\n(00:58:11) Supplement Dependency?, Placebo Effects\n(01:02:45) AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n(01:03:53) Nutrition & Behavior for Hormone Health\n(01:08:59) Hormone Health: Shilajit, Ashwagandha, L-Carnitine, Maca Root \n(01:12:48) Growth Hormone: Behaviors, Arginine, Prescriptions \n(01:16:04) Testosterone/Estrogen: Fadogia Agrestis; Bloodwork \n(01:23:06) Testosterone Supplement: Tongkat Ali, Libido \n(01:27:24) Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control & Fertility\n(01:30:54) Cognitive Enhancement & Focus, Sleep, Stimulants: Caffeine \n(01:36:57) Adrenaline & Stimulants: Yohimbine, Rauwolscine\n(01:38:55) Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements\n(01:43:58) Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n(01:47:25) Food-Mimic Supplements, Protein \n(01:50:09) Kids, Aging & Supplements\n(01:55:25) A Rational Supplementation Protocol\n(01:58:36) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nDisclaimer\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac",

      "description": "My guest is Sam Harris, Ph.D. Sam earned his bachelor’s degree in philosophy from Stanford University and his doctorate (Ph.D.) in neuroscience from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He is the author of multiple best-selling books and is a world-renowned public-facing intellectual on meditation, consciousness, free will, psychedelics and neuroscience. He is also the creator of Waking Up and the host of the Making Sense podcast. In this episode, we discuss meditation as a route to understanding “the self” and experiencing consciousness, not just changing one’s conscious state. Sam describes several meditation techniques and their benefits, including how meditation fundamentally changes our worldview and how it can be merged seamlessly into daily life. It can help us overcome universal challenges such as distractibility and persistent, internal dialogue (“chatter”) to allow for deep contentment and pervasive shifts in our awareness, all while acknowledging the more immediate stress-lowering and memory-improving effects of meditation. We also discuss the therapeutic use of psychedelics and the mechanistic similarities between the benefits of a psychedelic journey and long-term meditation practices. And we discuss the rationale behind Sam’s recent decision to close his social media (Twitter) account. This episode should interest anyone wanting to learn more about the higher order functions of the brain, the brain-body connection, consciousness and, of course, meditation and why and how to meditate for maximum benefit.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman\nWHOOP: https://join.whoop.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Sam Harris \n(00:04:36) Levels, WHOOP, Eight Sleep, Momentous\n(00:08:54) Sense of Self & Meditation, Dualism of Self\n(00:18:07) Sense of Self in Brain & Body \n(00:25:28) Consciousness vs. Contents, Meditation\n(00:28:25) Interrupting Sense of Self & Attentional Focus, Visual Saccade \n(00:33:30) Observer & Actor, Default Mode Network & Meditation, Blind Spot\n(00:40:48) AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n(00:41:57) Mediation & Paths to Understanding Consciousness, Non-Dualistic Experience\n(00:57:32) Sense of Self throughout Evolution \n(01:07:40) Sense of Self from Human Development, Language\n(01:18:42) InsideTracker\n(01:19:46) Internal Dialogue, Distractibility & Mindfulness \n(01:26:27) Time Perception & Mindfulness, Vipassana Meditation, Resistance & Pain\n(01:37:13) Consciousness & Sense of Control, Free Will\n(01:43:14) Authoring Thoughts: Storytelling & Ideas, Free Will\n(01:52:11) Meditation & the Paradoxical Search for Self\n(02:06:44) Meditation & Concentration Practice \n(02:11:58) Mindfulness, “Skylike Mind” & Thoughts\n(02:15:11) States of Self & Context, Dualistic Experiences\n(02:32:39) Distraction & Identification of Thoughts, Meditation & “Flow” States\n(02:42:58) Eyes-Open Meditations, Sense of Self, Visual Cues & Social Interactions\n(02:54:59) Paths to Meditation, Mindfulness Meditation Step-Functions\n(03:05:58) Psychedelics, MDMA & Experiences in Consciousness, Religion\n(03:21:11) Meditation, Psychedelic Journeys & Inner Truths\n(03:29:48) Psilocybin, Ego-Dissolution & Thought Expansion\n(03:40:09) Process vs. Achievement of Goals, Fulfillment in Present\n(03:54:29) Leaving Twitter; Conflict, Life Interruption & Politics \n(04:06:14) Social Media, Attentional Disruption & Deep Work\n(04:15:39) Meditation & Sense of Self\n(04:19:02) Sam Harris & Waking Up App, Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nDisclaimer\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac",

      "description": "My guest is Jocko Willink, a retired Navy SEAL officer and author of multiple books on effective leadership and teamwork, self-discipline and mindset, and host of the Jocko Podcast. We discuss how people can build and sculpt their identity and psychology through specific mindsets and actions and how to adapt the self to novel and challenging situations, using specific daily routines. We consider how “energy” actually stems from physical action and describe practical tools and scientific mechanisms for leveraging exercise, cold exposure, nutrition, fasting, hydration, sunlight, mindset and music to make us feel more energized and what that, in turn, does for our life. Jocko explains how discipline and specific daily routines allow for productivity and creativity. And we discuss the qualities of successful leaders, including how to build confidence and real bonds when working with a team or family/friends. Jocko describes a particularly powerful tool of using perspective shifts to allow for ‘detachment’ as a unique way to identify novel solutions to problems. We also discuss the power of early developmental narratives and how experiences of friendship, love, connection and loss can serve as pillars for making us better human beings in all aspects of life. Our conversation covers a wide range of topics, including mental health, physical health and performance, and provides actionable tools that anyone, regardless of age or profession, can apply to live a more effective and meaningful life.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nMaui Nui: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Jocko Willink\n(00:03:50) Maui Nui Venison, Eight Sleep, LMNT, Momentous\n(00:08:42) Sense of Self, Discovery & Autonomy\n(00:19:11) Mindsets in the Military: Garrison vs. Combat\n(00:25:02) Military Divisions\n(00:29:34) Daily Workouts & Discipline\n(00:35:39) AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n(00:36:53) Energy & Movement, Cortisol, Nutrition\n(00:52:10) Exercise & Energy, Deliberate Cold Exposure\n(00:59:05) Win vs. Loss Mindset, Leadership, Action & Energy \n(01:12:07) InsideTracker\n(01:13:11) Confidence, Generators vs. Projectors, Family\n(01:24:01) Restoring Motivation: Social Connection & Play\n(01:32:44) Self-Identity & Context, Alcohol, Music, Dopamine\n(01:45:10) Motivation Sources & Recovering from Loss\n(01:54:05) Suicide, Navy SEALs, Social Contagion\n(02:09:00) Suicide, Alcohol, Positive Action \n(02:15:03) Meditation, Detachment\n(02:20:30) Adaptability & Opportunities, Navy SEALs \n(02:30:43) Ambition & Love, Likeability, Leadership\n(02:40:18) Building Teams, Detachment, Family\n(02:50:20) Detachment: Problems & Perspective\n(02:55:55) Tools: Strategies to Detach from Situation\n(03:08:31) Tool: Situational Awareness & Detachment\n(03:17:49) Social Media, Personal Flaws\n(03:23:01) Falling Asleep & Detachment\n(03:27:02) Resilience Calibration, Navy SEAL Training & Combat\n(03:39:16) Deliberate Discomfort & Mental Resilience\n(03:42:21) People & Animals, Personalities\n(03:51:25) Political Leadership & Military, Social Media\n(04:01:38) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\nDisclaimer\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac",

I discuss how convergent and divergent thinking are essential for generating creative ideas and provide three types of meditation tools (open monitoring meditation, focused attention meditation & non-sleep deep rest; NSDR), which improve our ability to engage in these creative thinking patterns in specific and powerful ways. I also discuss how dopamine and mood contribute to the creative process and describe behavioral, nutritional and supplementation-based approaches for increasing dopamine to engage in creative thought and implementation. I explain how movement and storytelling (narrative) approaches can generate novel creative ideas and how substances like alcohol, cannabis, and psilocybin impact our creative ability. Excitingly, creativity is a skill that can be cultivated and enhanced; this episode outlines many tools to help anyone access creativity and apply creative patterns of thought to different domains of life.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nROKA: https://www.roka.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Creativity\n(00:04:30) ROKA, Thesis, LMNT, Momentous\n(00:08:51) What is Creativity?\n(00:11:16) Creativity in Visual Arts, Escher & Banksy\n(00:23:37) Neural Circuits of Creativity\n(00:31:58) AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n(00:33:13) Creative Ideas & Divergent Thinking\n(00:42:09) Testing Creative Ideas & Convergent Thinking\n(00:46:41) Dopamine, Convergent & Divergent Thinking Pathways\n(00:57:02) InsideTracker\n(00:58:06) Tool: Open Monitoring Meditation & Divergent Thinking\n(01:07:38) Tool: Focused Attention Meditation & Convergent Thinking\n(01:11:06) Mood, Creativity & Dopamine\n(01:16:00) Tool: Mood Calibrating, Caffeine & Dopamine\n(01:23:41) Dopamine Supplementation; L-Tyrosine, Caffeine\n(01:30:15) Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest, Mesocortical Dopamine & Divergent Thinking\n(01:43:13) Serotonin, Psylocibin & Creative Thinking\n(01:49:13) Alcohol & Autobiographical Scripting; Cannabis\n(01:52:04) Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Creativity\n(01:54:45) Tool: Movement & Divergent Thinking\n(02:01:02) Tool: Narratives & Storytelling for Creativity\n(02:14:47) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\nDisclaimer\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac",

      "description": "My guest is Kyle Gillett, MD, a dual board-certified physician in family medicine and obesity medicine and an expert in optimizing hormone levels to improve overall health. We discuss how to optimize male hormones using a range of nutritional and behavioral tools, exercise, and supplementation (including discussions on tongkat ali, fadogia agrestis, creatine, peptides and more). We explain how puberty and aging affect hormone levels, how to use bloodwork to monitor hormone levels, how hormone health impacts fertility, libido, hair loss, and prostate health, and describe behaviors that negatively impact testosterone levels. We also discuss how to approach prescription hormone therapies, including which biomarkers to monitor when using these approaches and how to optimize synergistic hormones (e.g., growth hormone and thyroid hormone) to support complete hormone health safely and rationally. Dr. Gillett offers numerous actionable tools that can be tailored to specific goals and age ranges to attain and maintain optimal levels of male hormones for overall health, well-being and longevity. \nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAthletic Greens: https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Kyle Gillett & Male Hormone Optimization\n(00:03:56) Sponsors: LMNT, Thesis, Momentous\n(00:07:43) Puberty: Height, Resistance Training, Childhood Obesity\n(00:15:14) “First” vs. “Second” Puberty\n(00:17:17) Hormone Optimization & Blood Work\n(00:22:14) Diet, Exercise, Sleep & Hormones\n(00:28:23) Hormones, Stress, Social Connection & Purpose\n(00:32:19) Hormones, Supplementation & Medication\n(00:34:08) Determining Individual Hormone Levels, ADAM Questionnaire\n(00:40:35) Libido, Masturbation, Pornography & the Dopamine “Wave Pool”\n(00:47:56) Sponsor: AG1 \n(00:49:46) Sustainable Exercise Regimen for Hormone Health\n(00:58:12) Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)\n(01:01:02) Supplementation: Creatine & Hair Loss, Betaine, L-Carnitine & Allicin (Garlic)\n(01:11:45) Vitamin D, Boron; SHBG & Free Testosterone\n(01:15:34) Sponsor: InsideTracker\n(01:16:39) Tongkat Ali (Eurycoma longifolia; Longjack) & Steroid Pathways\n(01:22:09) Fadogia Agrestis & Testosterone \n(01:26:32) Optimize Growth Hormone & IGF-1: Diet, Fasting, Supplements & Exercise \n(01:31:52) Optimize Thyroid Hormone: Iodine & Goitrogens\n(01:33:56) Peptides: Growth Hormone, Tesamorelin, Ibutamoren & Gut Microbiome\n(01:42:06) Testosterone Therapy\n(01:47:03) Prescriptions & Hormones: Human Choriogonadotropin (HCG), Clomiphene\n(01:52:56) Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature\n(01:55:30) Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat\n(02:06:08) Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)\n(02:09:56) Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids\n(02:18:13) BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health\n(02:21:55) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Social Media, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

I explain how caffeine powerfully reinforces the consumption of certain foods and drinks—thereby increasing how much we like their tastes and seek them out. I discuss the mechanisms by which caffeine increases focus, alertness and mood and reduces sleepiness. I also explain many practical tools for caffeine use, including delaying caffeine intake after waking, intermittent caffeine use, during fasting, before and during exercise, and the use of theanine to curb jitters caused by caffeine. I also discuss the positive effects of caffeine on overall health and longevity and address several myths about caffeine.

We discuss Lex’s recent trip to the heart of the Ukrainian-Russian War, geopolitics, perspectives on people living in war zones, the shared human experience, and how information is communicated and controlled. As an experienced podcaster and public educator, Dr. Fridman offers unique insights into the art of holding conversations that grow understanding, especially when they involve people with opposing viewpoints. We also discuss the peer-review process for scientific research publications and how social media and podcasts are evolving the way science and technology are communicated.

He explains the important connection between nutrition, metabolism and mental health and his pioneering work using the ketogenic diet to successfully treat patients with various mental illnesses, including depression and schizophrenia. Dr. Palmer explains how the ketogenic diet is an evidenced-based treatment for epilepsy, mimics the fasted state and can offset the cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s. He describes the key roles of mitochondria in mental health, how certain conditions likely arise from mitochondrial dysfunction, and how low-carbohydrate diets increase mitochondrial turnover to improve mental health. He also explains how low-carbohydrate diets positively impact the gut microbiome and weight loss, important risk factors for mitochondrial health such as marijuana and alcohol, and the best way to increase circulating ketones depending on individual needs. We also cover how a ketogenic diet impacts mood, sleep, and fertility. Dr. Palmer’s work stands as a revolutionary approach to mental health and disease that, given the prevalence of mental health challenges, should be of interest to people of all backgrounds and ages.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAthletic Greens: https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Chris Palmer, Mental Health & Metabolic Disorders\n(00:03:42) Sponsors: LMNT, Thesis, Momentous\n(00:07:18) Nutrition & Mental Health\n(00:20:43) Low-Carb Diets & Anti-Depression, Fasting, Ketosis\n(00:27:52) Schizophrenia, Depression & Ketogenic Diet\n(00:33:58) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:35:38) Psychiatric Mediations, Diet Adherence\n(00:42:35) Highly Processed Foods, Ketones & Mental Health Benefits\n(00:46:51) Ketogenic Diet & Epilepsy Treatment\n(00:56:10) Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria Health\n(00:57:05) Nutrition & Benefits for Neurologic/Psychiatric Disorders\n(01:05:44) Mitochondrial Function & Mental Health\n(01:15:12) InsideTracker\n(01:16:23) Mitophagy, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Aging & Diet\n(01:25:09) Neurons, Mitochondria & Blood Glucose\n(01:31:54) Obesity, Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria\n(01:40:00) Mitochondrial Function: Inheritance, Risk Factors, Marijuana \n(01:46:34) Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet\n(01:55:21) Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones\n(02:01:05) Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet\n(02:06:27) Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose \n(02:10:16) Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet\n(02:23:45) Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss\n(02:35:47) Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep\n(02:46:37) Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility\n(02:52:23) Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications \n(03:01:01) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

      "description": "I explain the science of happiness, including the different types of happiness and how our actions, circumstances and mindset control them. While it is difficult to standardize happiness from one person to the next, I outline a structured framework of what is critical to increasing your innate “natural happiness,” including financial security, purposeful work and relationships, and I explain specific tools to increase internal happiness (so-called “synthetic happiness”). I review how specific types of human connection and attention to our choices (or lack thereof) can increase or undermine our level of happiness. I also discuss the importance of certain types of physical contact, gratitude, financial choices and volunteer contributions that research shows can maximize happiness. And I discuss how factors such as children, pets, physical well-being, substance use, prior traumas and life-phase milestones affect our quest for and depth of happiness.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAthletic Greens: https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Happiness\n(00:06:27) Tool: Light Exposure Timing & Brightness Timing\n(00:14:30) Sponsors: LMNT, Thesis, Momentous\n(00:17:51) Imprecise Language for Happiness\n(00:20:26) Happiness: Neuromodulators & Neurotransmitters \n(00:26:32) Harvard Happiness Project \n(00:29:22) Income & Happiness; Social Interactions & Peer Group \n(00:37:20) Work, Sense of Meaning & Happiness\n(00:40:13) Toolkit for General Wellbeing\n(00:43:06) Happiness Across the Lifespan, Does Having Children Make Us Happier?\n(00:47:20) Sponsor: AG1 \n(00:50:20) Birthdays & Evaluated Happiness\n(00:52:45) Smoking, Alcohol & Happiness\n(00:54:23) Trauma & Happiness, Lottery Winner vs. Paraplegic Accident\n(01:05:05) Synthesizing Happiness\n(01:09:18) Natural Happiness & Synthetic Happiness; Music\n(01:13:45) Tool: Synthesizing Happiness: Effort, Environment & Gratitude\n(01:24:50) Tool: Pro-Social Spending/Effort, Happiness\n(01:31:55) Tool: Focus, Wandering Mind & Meditation \n(01:39:40) Tool: Quality Social Connection\n(01:41:28) Brief Social Connection, Facial Recognition & Predictability\n(01:46:33) Deep Social Connection, Presence & Eye Contact\n(01:54:00) Physical Contact & Social Connection, Allogrooming, Pets\n(02:03:00) Freedom & Choice; Synthetic Happiness\n(02:11:57) Happiness Toolkit\n(02:22:00) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

We discuss the science of energy utilization and balance, the efficacy of different diets (e.g., ketogenic, vegan, vegetarian, carnivore, omnivore), and how best to build lean muscle mass and lose fat. We also discuss optimal protein and fiber intake, the best sources of protein, the correlation between appetite, satiety signals and exercise, along with male and female-specific needs. Dr. Norton also explains how to support a healthy gut microbiome and offers insight into sugar and artificial sweeteners, processed, cooked, and raw foods, supplements, seed oils, and the relationship of LDL/HDL levels to cardiovascular health.

I explain key meditation principles, such as using specific breathwork patterns and adjusting your perception to specific locations along the continuum between interoception, exteroception and dissociation. I discuss how meditation practices lead to long-term trait changes and neuroplasticity, including changing your default mood, reducing baseline anxiety/depression, increasing your ability to focus, enhancing relaxation, improving sleep, and increasing your overall happiness level. I also explain the concept behind the “third-eye center,” what mindfulness is from a biological standpoint, the power of ultra-brief meditations and how to select the best meditation and time and duration to meditate to meet your need. I also explain a novel open-eyed perception-based meditation that may enhance focus, relaxation and task-switching ability.

      "description": "I describe a fitness protocol that maximizes all the major sought-after aspects of physical fitness, including strength, endurance and flexibility. I discuss fundamentals of resistance training protocols, including repetitions, sets, inter-set and inter-workout rest periods and periodization of intensity and volume to improve strength and hypertrophy. I also explain how to integrate this with endurance training across the week by controlling the duration, timing and intensity of cardiovascular workouts. I also cover science-based protocols on leveraging the mind-body connection, deliberate breathing (during and after exercise), stretching, deliberate heat and cold exposure, and non-sleep deep rest (NSDR) for better workout performance and faster recovery. Further, I tackle a range of real-world issues that can affect a consistent training schedule, such as whether you should train if you are sick, have had a poor night of sleep or had a stressful event and how to start training again after a break and whether you should train in a fasted or fed state. Physical fitness is a key variable for immediate and long-term health. This episode provides a modifiable “foundational” template that can be adjusted based on your current fitness level, goals, time constraints, and access to different types of equipment.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Foundational Protocol for Fitness\n(00:04:35) Tool: Soleus (Calf) Push-Ups, Glucose Utilization & Metabolism\n(00:13:49) Sponsors: LMNT, Thesis, Momentous\n(00:18:53) Core Principles of Fitness & Modifiable Variables\n(00:23:37) Day 1: Long Endurance Workout\n(00:34:38) Day 2: Leg Resistance Training, Strength & Hypertrophy\n(00:36:13) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:39:22) Key Principles of Resistance Training\n(00:51:10) Day 3: Heat & Cold Exposure, Recovery\n(01:00:35) Day 4: Torso & Neck Resistance Training\n(01:09:55) Day 5: Moderate Intensity Cardiovascular Training, Running Alternatives\n(01:16:43) Day 6: High-Intensity Interval Training, Maximum Heart Rate\n(01:24:10) Day 7: Arms, Neck & Calves Resistance Training\n(01:28:45) Flexibility of Foundational Protocol, Workout Spacing\n(01:33:00) Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs \n(01:37:10) Safety & Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts\n(01:38:32) Tool: Stress or Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR\n(01:41:20) Should You Train Fasted or Fed?\n(01:43:58) Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training\n(01:49:10) Tool: Hanging from a Bar & Fitness Metric \n(01:50:16) Should You Train Sick?, Ramping Training\n(01:53:33) Tool: Deliberate Slow Breathing & Recovery\n(01:55:00) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Huberman Lab Premium, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

He is also the Director of the Stanford Brain Stimulation Lab. We discuss clinical applications for brain stimulation, behavioral protocols and novel drug treatments to halt and reverse mental health disorders, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We first discuss the neural circuits for self-identity and mood and stress control. We discuss Dr. Williams’ work using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to depression, trauma, PTSD, and other mood disorders. We then dive deep into the history, biology, modern use, and safety margins of the various psychedelics, including MDMA, LSD, ketamine, ibogaine, ayahuasca, and psilocybin, as well as cannabis and the use of SSRIs in both adults and children. Finally, we discuss behavioral treatments for mental health disorders, including sleep and sleep deprivation, light exposure, exercise, and training to control the brain-heart-rate pathways. Regardless of age, all those interested in mental health should benefit from the incredible breadth and depth of Dr. Williams’ knowledge and the clarity with which he conveys that information.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Nolan Williams, Brain Stimulation & Depression Treatment\n(00:03:48) Sponsors: LMNT, Thesis, Momentous\n(00:08:37) Momentous Supplements\n(00:09:16) Depression, Risk Factors, Emergency Psychiatric Treatments\n(00:15:11) The Brain-Heart Connection, Vagus Nerve, Prefrontal Cortex\n(00:17:51) Right vs. Left Brain Hemispheres & Mood Balance, Connectome\n(00:22:34) Heart Rate & Depression, Behavioral Interventions, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)\n(00:33:02) Prefrontal Cortex & Cognitive Control, TMS\n(00:35:30) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:39:00) Belief/Identity “Rules”, Re-scripting, TMS & Talk Therapy\n(00:45:49) Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex, TMS & Depression Treatment\n(00:48:36) Cingulate Cortex & Emotion, Dissociation & Catatonia\n(00:54:27) Ketamine, the Opioid System & Depression; Psychedelic Experience or Biology?\n(01:03:42) SSRIs, Serotonin & Depression; Childhood, Chemical Imbalance or Circuit?\n(01:13:58) Memories & “Rule” Creation; Psilocybin & “Rule” Resolution\n(01:21:00) MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment, Psilocybin & Depression Treatment\n(01:24:12) Is MDMA Neurotoxic?, Drug Purity, Dopamine Surges, Post-MDMA Prolactin\n(01:30:38) Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity & Depression Treatment\n(01:34:53) Exposure Response Prevention: “Letting Go” & Depression Treatment\n(01:41:23) Normal Spectrums for Mental Health Disorders\n(01:45:35) Ibogaine & “Life Review”; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials\n(01:57:16) Clinical Use of Psychedelics\n(02:01:59) Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study\n(02:06:55) Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses\n(02:14:52) Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol\n(02:20:42) Circadian Reset for Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light\n(02:28:43) Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study\n(02:34:25) Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation\n(02:45:35) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Huberman Lab Premium, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

I also cover the known adverse health consequences of chronic and even acute (one-time) use and the factors that determine if cannabis is helpful or harmful. Additionally, I detail how the various strains of cannabis: sativa, indica and hybrid strains, can produce such divergent effects depending on the strain type, THC-to-CBD ratio, total dosage, and frequency of use. I review why cannabis can impact speech patterns and one’s propensity to develop anxiety/depression during and after use and, in some individuals, paranoia. As the legal landscape for cannabis is rapidly evolving, this episode should interest a wide audience, including former/current cannabis users, those in the medical, sports, law enforcement, and educational communities and, of course, children, teenagers, and parents.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Cannabis (Marijuana)\n(00:005:02) Sponsors: LMNT, Thesis, Momentous\n(00:07:03) Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR), Sleep & Anxiety\n(00:15:08) Cannabis Strains, Psychoactive Compounds: THC & CBD\n(00:19:34) Sativa vs. Indica, Stimulant vs. Relaxation Effects\n(00:25:55) Hybrid Cannabis Strains, Type 1, 2 & 3 Strains\n(00:31:56) Naturally Occurring Receptors: Nicotinic & Cannabinoid Receptors (CB1)\n(00:35:18) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:40:35) THC, CBD vs. Endogenous Cannabinoids, Dependence\n(00:43:14) Endogenous Cannabinoids, Cannabinoid Receptors & Nervous System Function\n(00:53:07) Biological Effects of Cannabis\n(00:56:29) Cannabis Sativa & Subjective Effects: Mood, Stress, Alertness, Paranoia\n(01:04:58) Cannabis Indica & Subjective Effects, Memory, Dosage\n(01:09:41) Brain Areas Affected by THC & CBD, Side Effects\n(01:16:08) Creativity: Convergent vs. Divergent Thinking & Dopamine\n(01:26:41) Does Cannabis Increase Creativity?\n(01:35:08) Chronic Cannabis Use & Changes in Speech Patterns\n(01:46:46) Cannabis & Libido, Dopamine & Prolactin\n(01:56:55) Cannabis & Hormones: Prolactin, Testosterone, Estrogen & Fertility\n(02:06:53) Smoking/Vaping Tobacco or Cannabis & Negative Health Consequences\n(02:10:06) Avoiding Cannabis During Pregnancy/Breastfeeding, Fetal Neural Development\n(02:18:13) Negative Health Consequences of Cannabis, Anxiety & Depression, Tolerance\n(02:25:57) Cannabis Use & Adolescence/Young Adulthood, Predisposition to Psychosis\n(02:34:36) Adolescent Cannabis Use: Brain Development & Mental Health Disorders\n(02:41:44) Cannabis & Pain Management, Divergent Effects of Cannabis\n(02:44:54) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Huberman Lab Premium, Momentous Supplements, Neural Network Newsletter, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn\n Title Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

Dr. Halpern’s research and clinical practice focus on using deep brain stimulation to treat compulsive and movement disorders (e.g., binge eating disorders, bulimia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Parkinson’s disease essential tremor, dystonia). We discuss using deep brain stimulation to help patients who suffer from movement and compulsive disorders and applying this treatment to patients afflicted with binge eating. We also explore applications of this technology to other conditions such as OCD, anorexia and tremor, and the future therapeutic directions of the use of non-invasive brain stimulation approaches, including transcranial magnetic stimulation and ultrasound, for the treatment of other psychiatric illnesses and conditions.

      "description": "In this episode, I explain how nicotine impacts the brain and body, including its potent ability to enhance attention, focus, and alertness, increase blood pressure and metabolism and reduce appetite. I discuss nicotine’s ability to increase the action of neurochemicals, including dopamine, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine and activate sympathetic (alertness-promoting) neural circuits. I also discuss common nicotine delivery methods, such as cigarettes, vaping, dip, and snuff, and how they each create their own unique experience and how they, but not nicotine itself, cause cancer and other adverse health effects. I also explain science-based tools to permanently quit smoking cigarettes or vaping, including peer-reviewed clinical hypnosis tools, antidepressants, and alternative nicotine replacement (patches, lozenges, gums etc.). As nicotine is one of the most widely used substances with billions of users — most of whom report wanting to quit — this episode ought to be of interest to former/current nicotine users, those who want to quit smoking or vaping and/or those interested in learning the biology behind how nicotine impacts the brain and body.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Nicotine\n(00:03:41) Tool: Brief Daily Meditation & Focus\n(00:05:59) The Arrow Model of Focus, Alpha GPC & Garlic Supplements\n(00:10:05) Sponsor: LMNT, Thesis, Momentous\n(00:14:35) Nicotine Effects vs. Methods of Delivery, Acetylcholine\n(00:19:55) Where is Nicotine Found?

      "description": "My guest is David Anderson, PhD, a world expert in the science of sexual behavior, violent aggression, fear and other motivated states. Dr. Anderson is a Professor of Biology at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), a member of the National Academy of Sciences and an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI). We discuss how states of mind (and body) arise and persist and how they probably better explain human behavior than emotions per se. We also discuss the many kinds of arousal that create varying levels of pressure for certain behaviors to emerge. We discuss different types of violent aggression and how they are impacted by biological sex, gender, context, prior experience, and hormones, and the neural interconnectedness of fear, aggression and sexual behavior. We also discuss peptides and their role in social isolation-induced anxiety and aggression. Dr. Anderson also describes novel, potentially powerful therapeutics for mental health. This episode should interest anyone wanting to learn more about mental health, human emotions, sexual and/or violent behavior.  \nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. David Anderson, Emotions & Aggression \n(00:03:49) Sponsors: LMNT, Thesis, Momentous\n(00:08:10) Emotions vs. States\n(00:10:36) Dimensions of States: Persistence, Intensity & Generalization\n(00:14:38) Arousal & Valence \n(00:18:11) Aggression, Optogenetics & Stimulating Aggression in Mice, VMH\n(00:24:42) Aggression Types: Offensive, Defensive & Predatory \n(00:29:20) Evolution & Development of Defensive vs. Offensive Behaviors, Fear\n(00:35:38) Hydraulic Pressures for States & Homeostasis\n(00:37:24) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:39:46) Hydraulic Pressure & Aggression\n(00:44:50) Balancing Fear & Aggression\n(00:48:31) Aggression & Hormones: Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone\n(00:52:33) Female Aggression, Motherhood\n(00:59:48) Mating & Aggressive Behaviors \n(01:05:10) Neurobiology of Sexual Fetishes \n(01:10:06) Temperature, Mating Behavior & Aggression\n(01:15:25) Mounting: Sexual Behavior or Dominance?\n(01:20:59) Females & Male-Type Mounting Behavior\n(01:24:40) PAG (Periaqueductal Gray) Brain Region: Pain Modulation & Fear \n(01:30:38) Tachykinins & Social Isolation: Anxiety, Fear & Aggression \n(01:43:49) Brain, Body & Emotions; Somatic Marker Hypothesis & Vagus Nerve \n(01:52:52) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, AG1 (Athletic Greens), Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter, Huberman Lab Clips\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",
